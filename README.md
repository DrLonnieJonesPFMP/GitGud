# Gitgud README
Gitgud is a start of a simple gamification for programming. It is designed to make programming more engaging and entertaining. The package includes several other extensions into a bundle. These extensions are:
    [Typing Sounds by ManhTuan] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MTuan.typing-sounds)
    [Code-Stats by Juha Ristolainen] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=riussi.code-stats-vscode)
    [Power Mode by Cody Hoover] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.vscode-power-mode)
    [Synthwave 84 by Robb Owen] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)
    [Giflens by Giflens] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=giflens.giflens)
    [Gif Code Snippet by Subhendukundu] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=subhendukundu.gif-code-snippet)
    [Code Time by Software.com] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.swdc-vscode)
    [Pomodoro Timer by Kaiyuan Liu] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lkytal.pomodoro)
    [Live Share by Microsoft] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
    [Live Share Pomodoro by Jonathan Carter] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lostintangent.vsls-pomodoro)

## Instructions
While most of the extensions come ready right from the start, some require a certain amount of configuration. Typing sounds can have the sound replaced with another file. Code-Stats, Code Time, and Live Share require logging into an account. Power Mode has a good base, but the particles can be altered to another gif. Synthwave requires the glow to be turned on and amplified. In the future, I would like to have the extension pack ready out of the installation.

The extension is designed for both individual and team based situations. I use Pomodor timers to effectively measure progress in general, per language, and per framework. Code-Stats, portfolio items, and examinations are the closest to measuring programming ability.

## Roadmap
Audio file replaced
Auto-configuration per OS type
Account sync
2FA
Indepth programming analytics
Add licenses per extension type
Create individual extension
Create icon
Create homepage

## Critical
**Enjoy!**
Learn to enjoy programming and improving on a regular basis. It isn't always the most lines of code, the most obscure, or the most clever answer. It is usually the simplest code that any other developer can read. Something developers and non-developers can appreciate and most importantly yourself.
